# Project Tasks: MCP-Server for Apache Solr (Focus: Document Search)

## 1. Project Setup (Updated: 26. April 2025)

- [x] Create `pyproject.toml` with necessary dependencies (MCP SDK, Pydantic, httpx, etc.)
- [x] Set up `.env.example` template with Solr connection and authentication variables
- [x] Establish project folder structure:

  ```plaintext
  /src
    server.py         # Main MCP server implementation
  /tests
    test_server.py    # Tests for the MCP server
  .env.example
  README.md
  PLANNING.md
  ```

- [ ] Initialize Git repository and create initial commit

## 2. MCP Server Development

- [x] Configure MCP server with lifespan management
- [x] Implement resource and tool structure for Solr integration
- [x] Create Pydantic models for request/response validation
- [ ] Add context management for user sessions (if needed)
- [x] Write unit tests for MCP server resources and tools

## 3. Apache Solr Integration

- [x] Implement Solr client class in server.py
- [x] Configure httpx for asynchronous Solr requests
- [x] Create search functionality as MCP resources and tools
- [x] Implement support for:
  - [x] Basic search functionality
  - [ ] Complex queries (facets, highlights, etc.)
  - [ ] Multiple cores/collections
  - [x] Document retrieval by ID
- [x] Add error handling for Solr connection and query issues
- [x] Write unit tests for Solr client functions

## 4. Authentication System (if needed)

- [ ] Create user management functionality
- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication with pyjwt
- [ ] Set up secure password hashing with passlib
- [ ] Build login function
- [ ] Implement token issuance, validation, and renewal functions
- [ ] Create authentication context for MCP tools and resources
- [ ] Configure optional role-based access control
- [ ] Write unit tests for authentication functionality

## 5. MCP Resources and Tools Enhancement

- [x] Implement search resource (`solr://search/{query}`):
  - [x] Simple interface for basic searches
  - [x] Error handling
- [x] Create search tool with advanced parameters:
  - [x] Query parameter validation
  - [x] Support for filter queries, sorting, and pagination
  - [ ] Support for facets and highlighting
- [x] Implement document retrieval tool:
  - [x] Support for retrieving by ID
  - [x] Support for field selection
  - [ ] Support for document transformation and formatting
- [ ] Add additional helper tools:
  - [ ] Collection/core management
  - [ ] Schema inspection
  - [ ] Statistics gathering
- [x] Write comprehensive tests:
  - [x] Expected behavior tests
  - [x] Edge case tests
  - [ ] Failure scenario tests

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

- [x] Implement basic error handling
- [ ] Create standardized error response models
- [ ] Configure logging system for requests and special events
- [ ] Add Solr error translation to readable user messages
- [ ] Implement request tracking and debugging tools
- [ ] Write tests for error handling scenarios

## 7. MCP Client Example (Optional)

- [ ] Create example MCP client to demonstrate usage
- [ ] Implement basic CLI for interacting with the MCP server
- [ ] Show how to integrate with LLM applications

## 8. Deployment Preparation

- [ ] Set up MCP CLI installation configuration
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for containerization
- [ ] Set up Docker Compose configuration
- [x] Document deployment process in README.md
- [x] Implement environment variable configuration
- [ ] Add health check capabilities
- [ ] Test deployment in containerized environment
- [ ] Test Claude Desktop integration

## 9. Documentation

- [x] Update README.md with:
  - [x] Project overview
  - [x] Setup instructions
  - [x] Usage examples
  - [x] MCP resources and tools documentation
- [x] Document environment variables in .env.example
- [ ] Add inline code documentation for all modules and functions
- [ ] Create example usage scripts

## Discovered During Work

- [ ] Investigate how to implement MCP server authentication best practices
- [ ] Explore creating a prompts interface for common Solr search templates
- [ ] Consider implementing MCP contexts for more complex operations (26. April 2025)
- [ ] Research MCP server monitoring and analytics capabilities (26. April 2025)
